1.  stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, together with the defined minimum and maximum allowable values for each type, using macros.
2.  The point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program is defining BYTE, DWORD, LONG, and WORD.
3.  1, 4, 4, 2.
4.  The first two bytes of any BMP file must be BM(ASCII), 66 77(decimal), 0x42 0x4D(hexadecimal).
5.  bfSize - size of the BMP file, biSize - size of the raw bitmap data (including padding).
6.  If biHeight is negative bitmaps are stored from the top to bottom and can't be compressed.
7.  BitCount
8.  fopen might return NULL in line 24 of copy.c if the file doesn't exist or if fopen isn't successful ( in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c).
9.  The third argument to fread is always 1 in our code to read one element of data.
10. TODO
11. The  fseek()  function  sets the file position indicator for the stream.
12. The position specified  by SEEK_CUR means the offset is relative to the current position indicator.
