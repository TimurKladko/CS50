0.  The longest word in English.
1.  int getrusage(int who, struct rusage *usage); getrusage() returns resource usage measures for who.
2.  16 members.
3.  Because they are structures. 
4.  We read each word’s characters one at a time. If the character is an alphabetical one or an apostrophe
    we append the character to the word. If the character is a number or the alphabetical string is
    too long to be a word we consume the remainder of the alphabetical string. If the character 
    is '\0' we've found a word. We update WORDS IN TEXT. Then we check word's spelling and update 
    TIME IN check. If the word is misspelled we print it and update WORDS MISSPELLED. Then we read 
    next word’s characters until the end of the text.
5.  We used fgetc to read each word’s characters one at a time to check if the character is 
    an alphabetical one or an apostrophe.
6.  We shouldn't  change those parameters in our program.
